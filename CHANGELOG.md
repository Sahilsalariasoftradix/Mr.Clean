# Changelog

All notable changes to Mr.Clean. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

### Design
- Works at any window size: the sidebar becomes an icon rail in narrow windows, side panels move below the main list, the Overview stacks and moves its stat bubbles under the storage orb when space is tight, and wide windows use the extra room. The window can now be as small as 760×560.

### Security
- New checks for the attack found in a pull request to this repo (a contributor's machine was compromised and the malware force-pushed itself into their branch):
  - VS Code / Cursor tasks set to run when a folder is opened (`runOn: folderOpen`), especially hidden ones, in projects and in your editor's own settings.
  - npm scripts (`dev`, `build`…) that start hidden code, or run a font or image file as code.
  - Scripts disguised as fonts, images or media files.
  - Code hidden behind walls of tabs, words spelled as `\u` escape codes, numbers disguised as XOR sums, and the global flags BeaverTail / InvisibleFerret loaders set.
  - Malware loaders running right now (from process command lines).
- The CI malware self-scan now uses the scanner from the target branch, so a pull request can't switch off the checks that scan it.

## v0.1.0 — first release

The first public build, for **macOS**, **Windows 10/11** and **Linux** (Ubuntu 22.04+).

### Overview
- Health headline ("Your Mac, in good shape" / "needs attention") with the reason, and a pill that jumps to the fix.
- Device card with the real model, chip, RAM and OS version (MacBook Pro, Lenovo ThinkPad, Dell XPS…).
- Glass storage orb, **Scan everything** (caches, `node_modules`, large files and security in one go), "What we found" and quick actions.
- Light and dark themes; motion respects Reduce motion.

### Clean
- Developer caches for Xcode, Android/Gradle, JavaScript package managers, CocoaPods, SwiftPM, pip, cargo, Go, .NET/NuGet, Homebrew, VS Code/Cursor, JetBrains/Android Studio, app caches, logs, Windows temp files and crash dumps; apt, journal, Flatpak and Snap on Linux (info only, with the command to free them).
- **Simulator runtimes** can be removed: counted once, shown by name ("iOS 17.5"), removed with Xcode's tool or one macOS password prompt.
- Filter chips, tool logos, and an Old `node_modules` panel that skips online-only iCloud/OneDrive copies.

### Files
- Fast home-folder scan, biggest files by type and age, search, and a side panel with what's inside.
- **"What is this?"** explanations for folders (Apple Intelligence caches, `.gemini`, AppData, Store apps, `~/.config`…), with advice on whether to delete.

### Security
- Checks for the Shai-Hulud npm worm, Contagious Interview / BeaverTail projects, known-bad npm versions, risky install scripts, git hooks and identity changes, shell and PowerShell profiles, exposed tokens.
- Startup items on every OS: LaunchAgents, cron, systemd and autostart, Windows Run keys, Startup folder and scheduled tasks.
- **Protection card**: FileVault/BitLocker/disk encryption, firewall, Gatekeeper/SmartScreen, System Integrity Protection/UAC, updates, remote login, each with **Fix** (opens the right settings page) or **How to fix**.
- One-click, confirmed fixes for a global git hooks folder and plain-text git passwords.
- Restorable **quarantine**; quarantining a Mac startup item also stops it straight away.

### Memory
- Apps / wired / compressed / free breakdown, 10-minute pressure chart, apps with their real icons, and developer leftovers you can quit safely.

### Safety
- Every delete passes one tested guard. It never touches your documents, cloud folders, credentials, system folders (`/System`, `C:\Windows`, Program Files…) or app data outside caches and logs. Items go to the Trash / Recycle Bin by default.
- Nothing is uploaded; there's no telemetry and no auto-update.
